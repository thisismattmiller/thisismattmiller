Watching the live stream of Trump's speech on Jan 6th 2021 on YouTube I was struck by the comment section on the video. Rendered pretty much useless by the sheer volume of comments flying up the window. It consisted of mostly Trump supporters shouting into the internet. Watching it trying to gauge some kind of zeitgeist of what was about to happen. At the time I lived only a few blocks from the National Mall and the situation was giving me serious anxiety. This little simulation recreates that feeling, as the Trump comments zip off screen it floats down to the right accumulating on top of eachother. As more are added they squeeze and compress, vibrate and breakout. You can click on the comment to remove it, but there are more on the way.

Best on desktop, probably doesnâ€™t work great on the phone. Take a <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismmiller/status/1479225479987089408">look at this video</a> for the general idea.
